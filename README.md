# CapitalQuiz
 Self-coded quiz to see if a user can correctly identify all 50 U.S. capitals with their corresponding, given state. When a user incorrectly identifies 3 different, capitals, the user has the option to review those 3 most recently missed. This program can become a template to generate quizzes for self-learning on other topics.
